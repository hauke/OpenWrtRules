# OpenWrt Rules

* The roles within the OpenWrt (formerly LEDE) project are: active members, inactive members, and non-members. There is no core developer group or any other specially privileged members.
* Members may voluntarily switch between active and inactive status at any time.
* The commit credentials of inactive members are revoked and will be restored upon their return to active status.
* Any active member may request that another member be moved to inactive status. This request must be sent by email to the person concerned, with the openwrt-adm mailing list in CC. If the person either agrees or does not respond within 30 days, they will be moved to inactive status.
* All active members have the right to vote and are invited to liberally exercise this voting right in order to keep a broad consensus on project matters.
* To propose changes to project matters or the overall development direction, a formal proposal must be sent to the openwrt-adm mailing list. The proposal must clearly describe the suggested changes and include a specific deadline for when the voting period will end. Active members may vote to either approve or disapprove the proposal.
* For the proposal to be accepted, it must achieve a two-thirds majority approval among the active members who participate in the vote. Additionally, it must receive approval from at least one-third of all active OpenWrt members, regardless of whether they participated in the vote.
* Changes to these rules require a 75% majority among the active members who participate in the vote, as well as 50% approval from all active OpenWrt members.
* Frequent contributors may become members after a simple vote among existing active members. Project members are free to suggest suitable candidates.
* Any votes and decisions made will be made public on the project websites.
* Project infrastructure should be outsourced FOSS community operated services whenever possible in order to allow project members to focus on actual development efforts.
* Any infrastructure that cannot be outsourced and/or is operated by the project itself shall be administrable by at least three different people to reduce the likelyhood of the project getting locked out due to operators being unreachable.
* Responsible operators for the various services shall be documented publicly.
* The project will not offer email accounts under its project domain for privacy and equality reasons.
* Be nice to each other.
